# Casino Gambling Application

This application is a work in progress. It uses WebSocket server with a React JS client.

## Technologies Used:

* React
* WebSocket
* Google Test

## Compatible OSes:

Windows 10 or 11, macOS 10.10, or Ubuntu 16 are recommended for the best compatibility and performance.

## System Requirements:

Hardware: At least 4GB of RAM and 10GB of storage space are required to run React and its associate tools smoothly.

A web browser and Internet access: A modern web browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari and Internet access are necessary for viewing and testing the application.

Node.js and npm installed: Make sure you have both installed on your system (https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Homebrew installed: Homebrew is needed to install CMake. To	 install	 Homebrew, simply paste the command from https://brew.sh into your terminal and run.

CMake installed: To	install CMake,	simply type “brew install	 cmake” in the	terminal.

## How to run the application:

To run the code, please follow the below instructions:

1. Open terminal and clone the repository

     <code>git clone https://github.com/tnhi26990/casino_games.git</code>

2. Navigate to the cloned repository
3. a. Run this in the base directory <code>git submodule update --init --recursive </code>

     b. Open two terminals, follow these instructions:

     In the first one:

     <code>mkdir build</code>

     <code>cd build</code>

     <code>cmake ..</code>

     <code>make</code>

     <code>./backend</code>

4. In the second terminal, run the following commands:

     ### `npm install`

     Installs the dependencies of the project. This script needs to be run once before you can run the application.

     ### `npm start`

     Runs the app in the development mode.\
     Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

     The page will reload when you make changes.\
     You may also see any lint errors in the console.

     ### `npm test`

     Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
     See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

     ### `npm run build`

     Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
     It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

     The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
     Your app is ready to be deployed!

     See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

     ### `npm run eject`

     **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

     If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

     Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of 
     the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

     You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand 
     that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
